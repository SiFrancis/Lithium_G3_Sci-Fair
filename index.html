                Pollution is a growing problem within today’s world. Cars, factories, and other human activities release various pollutants into the atmosphere. One of these is <b>carbon dioxide</b>. While this gas is naturally produced by humans and animals, too much of it traps heat into the atmosphere, speeding up global warming and slowly destroying the environment.
                <br><br>
                <img src="imgs/Photosynthesis_en.svg" alt="A diagram of photosynthesis." class="img-fluid w-25 rounded float-start pe-3">
                The most common method of removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is through planting trees. This is because plants and trees can convert carbon dioxide into oxygen in a process called <b>photosynthesis.</b> Photosynthesis is very important in balancing an ecosystem, since plants can absorb the excess carbon dioxide produced by humans and animals and in turn produce oxygen for those humans and animals to breathe. For this reason, plants and trees are described as the "lungs of the earth."
                <br><br>
                However, plants aren't the only organisms that photosynthesize. Algae such as phytoplankton in the ocean can also photosynthesize and produce oxygen. In fact, more than half of the oxygen in the planet is produced by marine algae, while plants produce only about 20%, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
                <br><br>
                Hopefully, after reading through our research, you will get to see the amazing potential that algae holds in helping the environment. Who knows; maybe future scientists such as you will be able to make innovations with algae in the future!
