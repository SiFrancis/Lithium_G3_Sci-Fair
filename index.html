                    <p><b>Carbon dioxide</b> is one of the most abundant greenhouse gases produced by human activity such as cars and factories. While it is produced naturally by humans and animals, too much of it traps heat in the atmosphere and speeds up global warming causing more devastation to the climate and the environment.</p>
    
                    <p>The most common method of slowing down this effect is by planting trees. This is because when plants photosynthesize, they absorb carbon dioxide in the air and turn them into oxygen that humans and animals can use to breathe. For this reason, plants and trees are sometimes nicknamed as “the lungs of the earth.”</p>
    
                    <p>However, terrestrial plants and trees are not the only organisms that photosynthesize. <b>Algae</b>, a type of organism that includes things like plankton and seaweed</p>

                  <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
